# Password Generator App

## Motivation

The objective of this project is to develop an alternative to this [project](https://github.com/moadams847/Flask-API-Password-Generator/tree/useOOPJS)
which receives JSON data from a flask-based API. This project, however, does not use an API and instead relies on javaScript to generate random characters.
